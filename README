This is an simple QT-OpenCV application. This project is to provide a GUI-framwork for CV applications.

Features:

1. Frame Rate indicator
2. Memory buffer usage (Useful to find out bottlenecks in-situ)
3. Camera selection interface
4. ROI selections
5. Mouse position indicator
6. Simple IP based filters (Canny, Erode, Dilate etc)
7. Multithreaded

Uses:

1. Basic framwork establishment
2. Easy to edit via QT designer
3. Showcasing basic IP applications of OpenCv in a pretty framework


Requirements:

1. OpenCV 2.*
2. QT 4
3. Qmake
4. QT designer (optional | A good GUI platform to make QT forms)
	- $ sudo apt-get install qt4-designer 
			OR
	- use synaptic

Compilation

 Run the pro file via qmake
  - $ mkdir release
	$ cd release
	$ qmake ..
	$ make
	$ ./qt-opencv-multithreaded

			OR

 Run via QT Designer
	1. Open Project
	2. Select the .pro file
	3. click build
	


Issues:

1. Code is not organized ,all in same folder. This is because of my lack experience in make Qmake files. This is my first
2. Too little OpenCV stuff. Just the basic IP stuff. Please to include more.
